      <LegalSection heading="What is Reelform?">
        <p>
          Reelform builds video-first websites. You describe your business, direct a cinematic hero
          video with Seedance, and Claude builds a complete single-page site around the footage.
          It all takes a few minutes, and you iterate through chat.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="How do credits work?">
        <p>
          Everything runs on credits. A video render costs a fixed amount shown before you
          confirm; a site build reserves a ceiling and charges only what it actually uses, so the
          number you see is the most it can cost. One credit is roughly $0.01 of value. Every new
          account starts with one complete website free: a hero video and a full site build. The
          free pair runs on a fixed preset, a 5-second 720p shot and a fast build, choosing the
          model, resolution and shot length is what a plan unlocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subscription credits refill monthly and roll over for up to {ROLLOVER_MONTHS} months, so
          a quiet month costs you nothing; top-up credits never expire, and plan credits are always
          spent first. You can see every
          credit movement under{" "}
          <a href="/account/credits" className="text-primary underline">
            Account → Credits &amp; activity
          </a>
          .
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="What happens if a generation fails?">
        <p>
          Credits for failed video renders or site builds are refunded to your balance
          automatically. The refund appears in your credit activity within a minute or two.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="What's the difference between plans and top-ups?">
        <p>
          Plans are monthly subscriptions with the best credit rate, and they are ideal if you build regularly.
          Top-ups are a subscriber add-on for the months you outrun your plan: one-time purchases
          at a slightly higher rate, and those credits never expire. You need an active plan to
          buy one.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="Where do I find my invoices?">
        <p>
          Every payment (subscriptions and top-ups) has a downloadable PDF invoice under{" "}
          <a href="/account/billing" className="text-primary underline">
            Account → Billing &amp; invoices
          </a>
          , along with your full payment history and total spend.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="How do I cancel or change my plan?">
        <p>
          Open the Stripe billing portal from{" "}
          <a href="/account/billing" className="text-primary underline">
            Account → Billing &amp; invoices
          </a>{" "}
          → &ldquo;Manage subscription&rdquo;. Changes take effect at the end of the current billing
          period; credits already granted stay on your account.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="Can I get a refund?">
        <p>
          Failed generations are always refunded in credits automatically. For money refunds, see
          our{" "}
          <a href="/refunds" className="text-primary underline">
            Refund Policy
          </a>. Unused top-ups and accidental charges are typically refundable within 14 days.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="Do I own the videos and sites I create?">
        <p>
          Yes. You own the sites and videos generated for your account and can export, host, and
          use them commercially. See the{" "}
          <a href="/terms" className="text-primary underline">
            Terms of Service
          </a>{" "}
          for details.

      <LegalSection heading="How do I delete my account?">
        <p>
          Go to{" "}
          <a href="/account/security" className="text-primary underline">
            Account → Security
          </a>{" "}
          → Danger zone. Deletion removes your profile, productions, videos, and remaining credits,
          and cancels any active subscription. It cannot be undone.
