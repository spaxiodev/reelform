        The whole loop takes a couple of minutes, but the difference between a flat result and a
        genuinely good one comes down to three short pieces of writing. Here&apos;s what each one
        needs.
      </p>

      <LegalSection heading="1. Write a brief Claude can build from">
        <p>
          The brief is the only thing Claude knows about your business. Vague briefs produce
          generic sites, so name the specifics: who the visitor is, what you want them to do, and
          the one thing that makes you different.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-ink">Weak:</strong> &ldquo;A website for my coffee shop.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-ink">Strong:</strong> &ldquo;Single-origin roastery in Trieste,
          open since 2019. Visitors are locals looking for a weekend sit-down and wholesale buyers
          looking for a supplier. Main action: book a tasting. Tone: warm, unfussy, a bit
          industrial. Sections: hero, our roast, tasting bookings, wholesale enquiry,
          visit us.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          You don&apos;t need to get it perfect. Anything you miss you can add later by chat, and
          the site rebuilds around it.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="2. Direct a shot Seedance can actually render">
        <p>
          Video models are good at atmosphere and camera movement, and weak at legible text, hands,
          logos and precise brand detail. Describe the <em>scene and the camera</em>, not a
          graphic design.
        </p>
        <p>
          A shot prompt that works usually names four things: the subject, the camera move, the
          lighting, and the mood. For example, &ldquo;slow dolly push across a marble counter,
          steam rising from a freshly pulled espresso, low golden window light, calm and
          unhurried.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Not sure where to start? The studio&apos;s <strong className="text-ink">Suggest a shot</strong>{" "}
          button writes one from your brief at no cost, and the shot-style chips give you a
          tested starting point to edit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing reaches your site without your approval. Reshoot as many times as you like. A
          render that fails is refunded automatically.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="3. Choose loop or scrub: they suit different things">
        <p>
          <strong className="text-ink">Ambient loop</strong> plays the footage continuously behind
          your hero. It suits mood, brand and atmosphere: hospitality, fashion, music, anything
          where the feeling matters more than the detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-ink">Scroll scrub</strong> ties playback to the scroll position,
          so the visitor drives the footage forward frame by frame. It suits reveals and
          progressions: property walkthroughs, product rotations, before-and-after, anything with a
          beginning and an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each clip in a production carries its own mode, so a single site can loop the hero and
          scrub a section further down.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="4. Iterate by chat, then ship">
        <p>
          Once the first build lands, the chat under the preview edits the live site. Be specific
          and concrete. &ldquo;Make the hero headline bigger and drop the subheading to one
          line&rdquo; lands better than &ldquo;make it pop&rdquo;. Each edit is billed on real
          token usage, so small changes cost very little.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you&apos;re happy, download the zip: an <code>index.html</code> plus every video it
          uses, with the paths already rewritten. Host it on any static host; there&apos;s no
          runtime dependency on us. You can also publish it to the{" "}
