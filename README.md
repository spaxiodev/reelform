# Reelform

AI video-first website builder. Users describe their business, direct a cinematic hero video with **Seedance** (hosted on the **Higgsfield** API), preview and reshoot it until they're happy, then send it to **Claude**, which builds a complete single-file website around the footage — playing as an ambient loop or scrubbing frame-by-frame with scroll. They keep iterating with either AI until it ships.

**Stack:** Next.js (App Router) · Supabase (auth + Postgres + RLS) · Stripe (subscriptions + credit top-ups) · Anthropic API (streaming, user-selectable model) · Higgsfield (hosted video models) · Vercel (hosting)

---

## How the product works

1. **Brief** — user names the project, picks an industry, describes the website.
2. **Direct** — user writes a shot prompt, picks resolution/length/ratio, and generates. The video renders asynchronously; the studio polls and shows it in a "dailies" player. The user can **reshoot as many times as they like** — nothing goes to Claude without approval.
3. **Build** — user picks playback mode (**ambient loop** or **scroll scrub**) and a Claude model (Haiku → Opus), then hits *Send to Claude*. The site streams in live and renders in a sandboxed iframe.
4. **Iterate** — chat box sends edit instructions to Claude (full current HTML is passed as context each time). Reshooting the video and telling Claude "swap in the new video" also works — the latest video URL is always injected server-side.
5. **Ship** — download the site as a zip (HTML plus every video, URLs rewritten to local files), or — on **Pro and Studio** — publish it live in one click to the user's *own* Vercel and Supabase accounts.

Every action is metered in credits with atomic spend/refund in Postgres. Failed generations are automatically refunded.

## Setup

### 1. Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the **SQL editor** and run `supabase/schema.sql` (tables, RLS, credit RPCs, rate-limit function, signup-bonus trigger). It is idempotent, so re-running it is safe.
   - `schema.sql` is the full current state for a **fresh** project. If you already have a database, apply the files in `supabase/migrations/` in filename order instead — they are the incremental path.
3. Copy from **Project Settings → API** into `.env.local`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
4. **Auth → URL Configuration**: set Site URL to your app URL, add `https://your-app/api/auth/callback` to redirect URLs.
   Every auth email (confirm signup, reset password, change email) links to `{{ .SiteURL }}/api/auth/callback`, so the Site URL must be the real production origin (`https://www.reelform.io`), and `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` needs to be on the redirect list for local work.
5. **Email templates** live in `supabase/templates/` and are wired up in `supabase/config.toml`. Push them to the hosted project with `supabase login` (as the project owner), `supabase link --project-ref <ref>`, then `supabase config push`. Or paste each file into **Auth → Emails** in the dashboard, with the subjects from `config.toml`. The templates use `{{ .TokenHash }}` links, which `/api/auth/callback` verifies server-side, so a link opened on another device or browser still works.
6. **SMTP**: the built-in sender is capped at a few emails per hour. Before launch, set a custom SMTP provider under **Auth → SMTP settings** so signups and password resets are not throttled.
7. Optional: under **Auth → Sign In / Up**, disable "Confirm email" for frictionless local testing (keep it on in production).

### 2. Anthropic

Create an API key at [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com) → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### 3. Higgsfield (video generation)

1. Create an account at [platform.higgsfield.ai](https://platform.higgsfield.ai) and generate an API key. Credentials come as a **key id + key secret** pair.
2. Set `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` and `HIGGSFIELD_API_SECRET` (or paste the combined `id:secret` string into `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` alone).
3. Optionally set `HIGGSFIELD_MODEL` to change the *default* model the server shoots with; the studio and create flow let each shot pick from the full catalog in `lib/higgsfield.ts` (every text-to-video model Higgsfield publishes, cheapest first). Capabilities come from the published OpenAPI spec, so a model that has no resolution or aspect-ratio control simply doesn't offer one, and a requested length snaps to the nearest take that model shoots. Per-model provider rates live in `VIDEO_MODEL_USD_PER_SECOND` in `lib/pricing.ts` — the catalog spans ~10× in price, so that table is what every quoted credit cost is derived from.

**Model availability is per account.** Higgsfield gates models: Seedance and Sora 2 answer `model_not_found` on this project's key. The catalog still lists them — `GET /api/video/models` probes each path and the picker greys out whatever this account can't reach, so nobody picks a certain failure. The probe is a POST with an empty body (`{}`): a permitted model answers `400` (missing `prompt`), an unavailable one answers `404 model_not_found`, and neither generates anything. **Never probe with a body the API might consider valid** — a request that validates starts a paid render, and at least one endpoint (`hailuo-2.3/pro`) silently ignores fields it doesn't recognise instead of rejecting them.

`GET /api/video/health` answers the same question about the provider as a whole (`live`/`offline`), which is what the status dot in the studio and create flow reads.

Higgsfield's own DoP tiers are image-to-video (they require an input frame), so they aren't wired into the prompt-only studio flow. To move to a different provider entirely, swap the two functions in `lib/higgsfield.ts` — the rest of the app only depends on `createVideoTask` / `getVideoTask`.

### 4. Stripe

1. In the Stripe dashboard create **6 Prices** and paste their ids into `.env.local`:

   | Product | Type | Amount | Env var |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Starter plan | Recurring monthly | $19 | `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER` |
   | Pro plan | Recurring monthly | $49 | `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` |
   | Studio plan | Recurring monthly | $129 | `STRIPE_PRICE_STUDIO` |
   | 900 credits | One-time | $10 | `STRIPE_PRICE_TOPUP_SMALL` |
   | 2,400 credits | One-time | $25 | `STRIPE_PRICE_TOPUP_MEDIUM` |
   | 6,200 credits | One-time | $60 | `STRIPE_PRICE_TOPUP_LARGE` |

2. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
3. Webhook: add an endpoint pointing at `https://your-app/api/stripe/webhook` listening to `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted` → copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   - Locally: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Enable the **customer portal** (Settings → Billing → Customer portal) so users can cancel/manage plans.

### 5. Email (Resend)

Product email goes out through [Resend](https://resend.com): a welcome message once the account is confirmed, receipts for top-ups and plan starts/renewals, a notice when a plan is canceled, and, for accounts that opted in, a short tips drip. The auth emails (confirm, reset password) still go through Supabase, see step 1.

1. Verify your sending domain under **Domains** and add the DNS records it gives you.
2. Create an API key → `RESEND_API_KEY`. Set `EMAIL_FROM` to a sender on that domain.
3. `openssl rand -base64 48` → `EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET`, and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTAL_ADDRESS` to the business mailing address. Marketing email stays off until both exist.
4. **Webhooks** → add `https://your-app/api/email/webhook` for `email.bounced`, `email.complained`, `contact.created`, `contact.updated` → `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Bounces and complaints stop further email to that address; contact events keep the opt-in flag in sync with anything done in Resend's UI.
5. Optional: create an **Audience** → `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID`. Every opt-in and opt-out is mirrored there, so one-off newsletters can be written and sent from **Broadcasts** without touching code. Put `{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}` in every broadcast; those unsubscribes flow back through the webhook above.
6. The drip runs daily from `vercel.json` → `/api/cron/email-drip`. Vercel provisions `CRON_SECRET`; locally, set one and `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" localhost:3000/api/cron/email-drip`.
7. To send the Supabase auth emails through Resend as well: **Auth → SMTP settings**, host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, user `resend`, password = the API key, sender = your `EMAIL_FROM` address.

**Consent and the law.** The app is built to CASL (Canada's anti-spam law) and Quebec's Law 25:

- Marketing email needs express opt-in. The signup checkbox is unchecked and separate from the terms; Google signups carry the same checkbox through the callback.
- Every consent is recorded with its date and source (`marketing_consent_at`, `marketing_consent_source`) and quoted back in the footer of each marketing email.
- Every marketing email carries the sender's legal name, mailing address, contact email, a working unsubscribe link, and `List-Unsubscribe` headers (one-click). Unsubscribing takes effect immediately and never requires signing in.
- Account email (receipts, plan changes, welcome) is sent regardless of consent, as CASL allows for transactional messages, but still stops for a bounced or complained address.
- `email_log` keeps one row per message sent (who, what, when) as the audit trail, and is deleted with the account.

The copy lives in `lib/email/templates.ts`; the frame that wraps it in `lib/email/layout.ts`. Adding a drip step is one entry in `DRIP` at the bottom of the templates file.

### 6. Run locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in everything above
npm install
npm run dev
```

`.env.example` documents every variable the app reads, and which ones are required.
Missing required vars are reported at server start by `instrumentation.ts` — loudly in
production (it refuses to boot), as a warning in development.

### 6. Deploy integrations (currently disabled — Pro/Studio "Publish live")

Lets customers push a finished site into **their own** Vercel and Supabase accounts.
Nothing is hosted by us, so a shipped site outlives the customer's subscription.
Skip this and the studio still offers the zip download.

> **Switched off at the source.** `DEPLOY_ENABLED` in `lib/pricing.ts` is `false`,
> so the plan perks, the pricing section, the studio's *Publish live* button and the
> account tab are all hidden — nothing advertises or offers a feature that would
> dead-end at `?error=not_configured`. Complete the steps below **and** flip that flag
> to `true` to bring it back everywhere at once.

1. Set `INTEGRATION_SECRET` (32+ random chars, `openssl rand -base64 48`). It encrypts
   the stored OAuth tokens; rotating it just forces everyone to reconnect.
2. Create a **Vercel integration** (Dashboard → Integrations → Console) with redirect
   URL `{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/integrations/vercel/callback` and read/write scopes on
   Deployments, Projects and Environment Variables. Fill in `VERCEL_CLIENT_ID`,
   `VERCEL_CLIENT_SECRET` and `VERCEL_INTEGRATION_SLUG`.
3. Create a **Supabase OAuth app** (Dashboard → Organization → OAuth Apps) with redirect
   URL `{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/integrations/supabase/callback`. Fill in
   `SUPABASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `SUPABASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. Run `supabase/migrations/20260819_deployments.sql` (or the whole `schema.sql`).

Customers connect their accounts at **Account → Deploy integrations**, then hit
*Publish live* in the studio.

### 7. Deploy Reelform itself to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub, import it in Vercel.
2. Add every variable from `.env.local` to Vercel project env vars; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the production URL.
3. Point the Stripe webhook and the Supabase auth redirect URLs at the production domain.
4. Site generation streams for up to 5 minutes (`maxDuration = 300` in `app/api/site/generate/route.ts`) — this requires a Vercel plan that allows it (Pro), or lower the value and prefer faster models on Hobby.

## Pricing model (and why it's profitable)

**1 credit ≈ $0.01 retail.** Action prices are set at roughly **2× the underlying provider cost**, so gross margin is ~50%+ before Stripe fees, and subscriptions improve it further because unused credits expire monthly (top-ups don't — that's the fairness lever).

| Action | Credits | Retail | Approx. provider cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video 720p · 5s | 100 | ~$1.00 | ~$0.50 |
| Video 1080p · 5s | 150 | ~$1.50 | ~$0.75 |
| Site build — Haiku 4.5 | 10 | ~$0.10 | ~$0.03–0.05 |
| Site build — Sonnet 4.6 | 35 | ~$0.35 | ~$0.10–0.20 |
| Site build — Opus 4.8 | 120 | ~$1.20 | ~$0.40–0.70 |

Plans: Starter $19 → 2,000 cr · Pro $49 → 6,000 cr · Studio $129 → 18,000 cr. New accounts get **one complete website free** — one hero video and one site build — instead of a credit float. Regenerating, editing or starting a second project needs a plan, which is the upgrade moment.

**Tune it in one place:** all numbers live in `lib/pricing.ts`. Watch your real Anthropic/Higgsfield invoices for the first weeks and adjust credit costs there; the ledger table (`credit_ledger`) gives you per-action usage analytics for free.

Protections already built in:
- Atomic spend via a Postgres function — no double-spend race conditions.
- Automatic refunds when a provider call fails or the model declines, guarded so a
  concurrent poll can't pay the same refund twice.
- Credits can only be changed by `security definer` RPCs called with the service-role key — clients can't touch balances.
- Per-user hourly rate limits on every endpoint that costs money at a provider
  (`lib/rate-limit.ts`). Credits cap *total* spend but not *rate*, and admin ids skip
  credits entirely — this is what stops a script from running up the Anthropic and
  Higgsfield bills. Limits are stored in Postgres, not memory, because the app runs
  serverless. Tune them in `lib/rate-limit.ts`.

## Architecture notes

- `lib/claude.ts` — streaming site generation. The system prompt enforces single-file HTML output, distinctive (non-generic) design, and contains the exact loop / scroll-scrub video integration patterns. Edits always pass the full current HTML and return a full document.
- `app/api/site/generate/route.ts` — spends credits, streams plain text to the client, persists the finished HTML, refunds on failure using an in-band error sentinel.
- `app/api/video/*` — creates the Higgsfield request and polls it; refunds on provider failure.
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — top-ups on `checkout.session.completed`, plan set + monthly credit grant on `invoice.paid` (covers first payment and renewals), status sync on subscription update/delete.
- `proxy.ts` — session refresh + auth gate for `/dashboard`, `/studio`, `/account` (Next 16 renamed `middleware` to `proxy`).
- `lib/site-bundle.ts` — the single definition of "what the site is": HTML + videos with URLs rewritten. The zip download, the Vercel deployment and the Supabase Storage upload all build from it, so a site can't behave one way downloaded and another way deployed.
- `lib/deploy.ts` — orchestrates a publish: provision the customer's Supabase project (a `site_submissions` table, insert-only for `anon`), inject its keys into the bundle so the site's forms work, then upload the bundle to their Vercel account. Enforces the plan gate and the live-site cap.
- `lib/vercel.ts` / `lib/supabase-mgmt.ts` — REST clients for the two provider APIs; `lib/integrations.ts` + `lib/crypto.ts` store the OAuth tokens sealed with AES-256-GCM in a table that has RLS on and **no policies**, so only the service-role client can read them.
- RLS everywhere; the service-role client is only used server-side for credit accounting, webhook fulfillment and deploys.

## Roadmap ideas

- Custom domains on deployed sites (Vercel domains API), and a submissions inbox in the dashboard.
- Multiple videos per site (per-section footage).
- Team workspaces; per-project shareable preview links.
- Image generation for non-hero assets.
